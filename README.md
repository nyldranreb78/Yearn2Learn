## Project Summary and Vision: **Yearn2Learn**

### **Summary**

We aim to create a study tool to help students in enhancing their learning experience by offering helpful aids, consisting of basic features such a note taking and trackers for deadlines and goals, alongside more advanced studying methods such as flash cards and study patterns such a Pomodoro pattern.

### Vision

The vision is to ultimately create something that goes beyond ordinary notes and recordings and make something that enhances the learning experience to greater heights.

## Core Features and User Stories

### 1. Dynamic Notepad
- As a student, I want to create/delete my class notes so that I can study anytime and anywhere.
- As a student, I want to edit/save my class notes so that I can ensure up-to-date and correct content.

### 2. Pomodoro Timer
- As a student that gets distracted easily, I want to be held accountable by being timed so that I can fully focus on working through class material.

### 3. Deadline & Goal Tracker
- As a full-time student, I want to be constantly reminded of my upcoming deadlines and some personal goals that I set for this term so that I don't lose track of them and increase my chances of accomplishing them in time.

### 4. Flash Card Creator
- As a student who loves using flash cards as part of studying, I want to have flash cards as part of my study tools so that I can study more efficiently.

### 5. Account Management
- As a new user, I want to register my account so that I can save my personal information/preference.
- As a user, I want to be able to sign in so that I could manage/customize my study plan.
- As a logged-in user, I want to be able to change my personal information.

### 6. Performance (Non-functional)
- As a student in large classes of 100 students or more, I want to be able to take and save my notes reliably even with 100 other students writing the same amount of notes as me at the same time so that I would be able to keep up with my classes' pace without worrying about losing my notes.
